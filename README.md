# firebase-mapper
attempt to make simple mapper for firebase structure

## create a blueprint and make model
documenent type database always means fat client. It is where the most of the logic comes when one chooses firebase as the storage. 
Anything beyond a symple example quickly becomes some sort of spagety type of code where developer is battling with either callback hell 
or nested promises couple of levels. 

## Why?
Storing data in document storage requires certain level of denormalization. Developer very quickly wandrs away from all nice tools relational database
offers and swimms in deep water of denormalized data.

## Soluction
Fb blue print and model tool is here to help in this battle.  The project aims to create factory method which creates firebase friendly data mapper, where in blue print we
define the structure and relations and let the model figure out all the denormalized data.
